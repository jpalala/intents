I have extracted @intent comments from the code in the folder: {folder_name}

Here are the intents:

{intents}

Please provide a concise, human-readable summary of what this folder does.
Focus on the overall purpose and functionality rather than individual lines of code.
Include any patterns or relationships you notice between the intents.
If there are multiple modules or files, summarize their roles.

Your response should be clear enough for a developer who is new to this project.
